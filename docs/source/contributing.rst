Contributing
==================================================

Contributions are welcome, through issues or pull requests. If any
part of the codebase or documentation is unclear, feel free to ask for
clarification.

This codebase has a 100% test coverage requirement. The when
submitting a pull request Travis CI will indicate if 100% test
coverage is reached as part of the build passing/failing. Pull
requests should include tests to maintain 100% test coverage (if
getting to 100% is a concern, still make the pull request, but please
add a comment explaining that 100% test coverage isn't met).
